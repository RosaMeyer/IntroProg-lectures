    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Code layout:**\n",
    "    * **Indentation:** Four spaces or tap\n",
    "    * **Line length:** Max of 79 characters (wrap line + indent properly)\n",
    "    * **Strings:** Use single or double quote (be consistent!)\n",
    "    * **White space:**\n",
    "        * After comma: ``x = [1, 2, 3]`` (not required)\n",
    "        * Around assignment: ``x = y``\n",
    "        * After colon: ``if x == 2: print(x)``\n",
    "        * Around operators with lowest priority in a calculation: ``c = (a+b) * (a-b)`` or `z = x*x + y*y` \n",
    "2. **Naming conventions:** Short, but also precise\n",
    "    * **Modules:** Lower case with potential underscores (e.g. ``numecon`` or ``num_econ``)\n",
    "    * **Classes:** Camel case (e.g. ``ConsumerClass``)\n",
    "    * **Variables, functions and methods:** Lower case with potential underscores   \n",
    "    * ... there is lot's of diffrent ways of naming variables: snake_case and camelCase are some of the more commen ones. It's not import which you chose to use, but be consistent!    \n",
    "3. **Ordered section comments:** Break your code into sections\n",
    "    * Give each section a name and a place in the ordering\n",
    "    * Level 1: a, b, c etc.\n",
    "    * Level 2: i, ii, iii, iv etc.\n",
    "    * Level 3: o, oo, ooo, oooo etc.\n",
    "4. **Line comments:** Small additional hints\n",
    "    * Again, short and precise\n",
    "    * Try to avoid just explaining what the code does (must provide additional information)\n",
    "5. **Docstrings:** Should be written for all functions, methods and classes (see how below) in the .py-file/modules"
